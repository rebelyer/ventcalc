# Ventcalc
## Description
Simple application used for estimation of air flows for rooms in building when planning mechanical ventilation. The main goals of this application is to help with estimating:
  * total pressure loss in installation at normal conditions,
  * total air volume for AHU (air handling unit) selection,
  * air duct sizing.

Also It aims to create reports of estimated savings on energy bills when installed in your house.
